    This html document contains an inline script tag full of code, which executes every time you refresh.
    To investigate further, open the file in a text editor (like SublimeText 2), and follow the
    instructions written into the code comments.

       *
       * These variables and values are being set up for you to set the stage of your explorations.
       * Other than creating variables, and assigning values to them, no work is being done by the
       * following block.
       *
       * Uncomment it and reload the page in your browser to see what happens when a little code
       * runs but has no side effects.

       * Explanation:
       *
       * The debugger statement has no user-visible effect, to prevent the people viewing your web
       * page from getting interrupted by developer tools and commands. As a developer though,
       * you'll want to step through the code, which you can do by opening the developer console,
       * and then refreshing the page. Debugger statements will only be paused at when the console
       * is already open at the moment the interpreter hits them.
       */

       * learn how the buttons work.

      /* When you've completed this step and refreshed:

       * to navigate through the code using the code navigation commands.

       *
       * Note, if you've still got the debugger line uncommented, you'll have to press "play" in
       * order to let the code run all the way down to the error. Alternatively, you may step over
       * line by line until you reach the error, to see the circumstances around the error in more
       * detail.

      /* When you've completed this step and refreshed:

       * None of the code in this script block will execute, since the interpreter sees the entire
       * block as unparsable in the first place.
       *
       * Explanation:
       *
       * When the intepreter sees a major issue in the structure of the code (like the mis-matched
       * paren style above), the whole file is ignored. You'll notice that the failure pattern is
       * considerably different from a runtime error, in that the symptoms are much further
       * reaching. In this case, no alerts, console logs, debuggers, or other work left in the code
       * can be seen to have any effect.
       *
       * If we had other files or other script tags within this file that were themselves free from
       * syntax errors, then they would be able to execute separately, despite the errors inside
       * this script block. But every line of code in this particular script block will be ignored.
